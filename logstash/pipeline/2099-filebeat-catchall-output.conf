# Specifically, this way filebeat can scoop up all logs in a target directory.
# The input pipeline tags it twice ["filebeat", "unidentified"] and then the
# filter/identification step removes the "unidentified" tag if the log source
# is identified to go into a specific index.
#
# This step catches any remaining "unidentified" input logs, so we know what we need
# to make further indexes for. Or ignore altogether.
